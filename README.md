# Run Built By Austin

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:

### npm install

### npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### NOTE
If you plan on running npm run build, please keep in mind that it is set to output to a directory outside of the project: '../../Builds/portfolio/build'. Please make sure you do not have a 'Builds' directory at this location as this process can be destructive.
